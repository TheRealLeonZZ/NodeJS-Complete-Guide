# 🚀 Node.js Learning Projects – Shop & Blog

Welcome to my Node.js journey! 🌱  
This repo contains two major projects I built to dive deep into backend development: **Shop** and **Blog**. Each taught me important concepts that I’ve documented here so I can revisit and refresh my knowledge whenever needed.

## 🛒 Shop Project – Fullstack Online Store

A complete online shopping platform where users can:

- 👤 Sign up / log in
- 📸 Upload products with pictures, descriptions, and prices
- 🛍️ Add items to cart and checkout with Stripe
- 🧾 Receive PDF receipts

### 🔧 What I Learned

- 🌐 Node.js basics – routes, dynamic data
- 🧩 Middlewares
- 🖼️ Templating with EJS
- 🔐 Authentication & Validation
- 🧠 MVC Architecture
- 💾 Working with **MongoDB** and **MySQL**
- 🍪 Sessions & Cookies
- 📬 Sending emails
- ⚠️ Error handling
- 📤 File uploads & downloads
- 📄 PDF generation for receipts
- 📊 Pagination
- 💳 Stripe integration for payments
- 🧩 User, Product, and Order modules and how they connect

## 📝 Blog Project – REST API + React Frontend

This project takes everything from the Shop backend and shifts to a **RESTful API** style. I connected it to a pre-built React frontend to create a blog platform where:

- Users can have **status messages**
- Users can **create**, **edit**, or **delete** posts with pictures and descriptions
- Authenticated access using **JWT tokens**

### 🌐 What I Learned

- 🧠 Building RESTful APIs
- 🔁 HTTP methods – `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`
- 📡 Fetching data from a frontend (React)
- 🛂 Token-based authentication with **JWT**
- 👤 User and Post models & their relationships
- ⏱️ Async/Await for cleaner asynchronous code
- 🔌 Real-time communication with WebSockets and Socket.io
- 🔍 Building flexible APIs with GraphQL
- 🚀 App Deployment – Learned how to deploy the app and run it in a production environment
- 🧪 Testing with Mocha & Chai – Wrote unit tests to ensure code quality and reliability

## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists

I made this README so future-me 👋 can:

- Quickly **remember** what this repo includes
- Use it as a **reference** for concepts I’ve already implemented
- Know when and how I can **reuse code** or **patterns** from here

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

This repo shows my progress and what I’ve learned while working with **Node.js**.  
From building dynamic websites to full-fledged APIs, it’s been a great experience! 🎉
